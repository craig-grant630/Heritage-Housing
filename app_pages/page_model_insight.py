        - The objective was to build a model capable of accurately predicting house sale prices.
        - Our performance target was an **R¬≤ score of at least 0.75** on both training and test sets.
        - After evaluating multiple algorithms, **ExtraTreesRegressor** was selected for its strong and consistent performance.
        - Final pipeline results:
            - **Train R¬≤ Score:** 1
            - **Test R¬≤ Score:** 0.856
        - This performance meets the client's accuracy requirements.
