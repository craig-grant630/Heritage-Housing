    ### üèÅ Summary of Key Findings
    - All six selected variables show a positive correlation with SalePrice, 
    indicating that as their values increase, the sale price of the properties 
    tends to increase as well. This suggests these features are meaningful 
    drivers of property value.

    - Among these variables, YearBuilt has the least impact on SalePrice. 
    This could imply that while the age of a house matters, other factors have 
    a stronger influence on pricing in this dataset.

    - TotalBsmtSF (Total Basement Square Footage) emerges as the most 
    important predictor, highlighting that larger basement areas significantly 
    contribute to higher sale prices. This aligns with the intuition that 
    additional living or storage space adds value.

    - The remaining variables‚Äîsuch as 1stFlrSF, GarageArea, GrLivArea, and 
    OverallQual‚Äîalso show strong positive relationships with SalePrice, 
    reinforcing their relevance as key factors in determining home value.
